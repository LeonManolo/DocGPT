DocGPT generates comprehensive doc comments for your code leveraging the Chat GPT API. This IntelliJ plugin streamlines your documentation workflow and ensures a consistent comment style throughout your codebase.
<p>
    Currently, DocGPT supports Java, Kotlin, and Dart languages. To make use of this plugin, you need to add your API key in the IntelliJ settings under Settings/Tools/DocGPT. To generate a doc comment for a function, select the function's name with the cursor, press Alt + Enter, then choose "Generate doc comment" from the menu.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that DocGPT currently supports generating doc comments for functions only. The plugin is still under development and has not been extensively tested yet. As such, it is recommended to use it with caution and understanding of these limitations.
